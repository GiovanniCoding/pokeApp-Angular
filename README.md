## Description

_Example of Angular use, using Supabase as backend_

## Important points
- In Supabase the database was used to store the pokemon chosen as favorites, as well as the user's data.
- Authentication methods were used.
  - Functions and triggers were implemented for the automatic creation of the user profile in the database, as well as limiting CRUD options based on authentication
- As the data is being stored in Supabase, it is possible to select favorites and the data will be retained.
